### All users now on New Navigation

With this sprint all users have been moved to the New Navigation. Weâ€™ve removed the preview feature toggle that allowed users to return to the previous navigation model. To learn more about navigating in the web portal, see [Web portal navigation in Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index?tabs=new-nav&view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).
