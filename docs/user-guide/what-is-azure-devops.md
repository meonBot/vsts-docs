# What is Azure DevOps?

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-all-versions](../includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Azure DevOps provides developer services for support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Azure DevOps supports a culture and set of processes that bring developers and project managers and contributors together to complete software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.

You can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services or on-premises using Azure DevOps Server. For information on the differences between the cloud versus on-premises platforms, see [Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server](about-azure-devops-services-tfs.md).

Azure DevOps provides integrated features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client. You can use one or more of the following standalone services based on your business needs:

- **Azure Repos** provides Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source control of your code. For more information about Azure Repos, see [What is Azure Repos?](../repos/get-started/what-is-repos.md).
- **Azure Pipelines** provides build and release services to support continuous integration and delivery of your applications. For more information about Azure Pipelines, see [What is Azure Pipelines?](../pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines.md).
- **Azure Boards** delivers a suite of Agile tools to support planning and tracking work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods. For more information about Azure Boards, see [What is Azure Boards?](../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md).
- **Azure Test Plans** provides several tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing and continuous testing. For more information about Azure Test Plans, see [Overview of Azure Test Plans](../test/overview.md)
- **Azure Artifacts** allows teams to share packages such as Maven, npm, NuGet, and more from public and private sources and integrate package sharing into your pipelines. For more information about Azure Artifacts, see [Overview of Azure Artifacts](../pipelines/artifacts/artifacts-overview.md).

You can also use the following collaboration tools:

- Customizable team dashboards with configurable widgets to share information, progress, and trends
- Built-in wikis for sharing information
- Configurable notifications

Azure DevOps supports adding extensions and integrating with other popular services, such as: Campfire, Slack, Trello, UserVoice, and more, and developing your own custom extensions.  

Azure DevOps Services supports integration with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. Azure DevOps Server supports integration with GitHub Enterprise Server repositories.
