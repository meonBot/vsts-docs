# Manage and organize queries   

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-all.md)]

Organize your personal or shared queries by adding a query folder. You can then add queries to or move existing queries into those folders. You can create queries and query folders from the web portal or from a supported client, such as Visual Studio Team Explorer and [Team Explorer Everywhere](../../user-guide/work-team-explorer.md#team-explorer-plug-in-for-eclipse), a plug-in for [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

> [!NOTE]  
> To create and manage queries in Visual Studio 2019, you need to [Set the Work Items experience](../work-items/set-work-item-experience-vs.md) to the legacy option.

## Open Queries 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/open-queries.md)] 



<a id="flat-list-query"/>
<a id="save" />

## Open, edit, and save a query  

The easiest way to define a query is to start with an existing shared query. 
The following example shows how to find all closed bugs by modifying the 
*Active Bugs* shared query provided with the Agile process template. Examples are based on the user interface provided through the web portal. 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

1. Open a shared query. For example, from the web portal, open the *Active Bugs* or similar flat list query.   

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Run Active bugs query](media/view-run-queries/run-active-bugs.png)  

   > [!TIP]  
   > If you're working in Visual Studio Team Explorer, open the **Work** page to access your queries and shared queries. If Team Explorer isn't visible, choose **View>Team Explorer** from the top level menu.   

1. Edit the query to find closed bugs and then run the query. 
   Use ![Insert new filter line](media/3.png) to insert a clause above the current clause. Use ![Remove this filter line](media/4.png) to delete a clause.  Queries are automatically scoped to the current project. To find work items defined in several projects, see [Query across projects](using-queries.md#across-projects). 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Web portal, Queries page, new queries experience, Editor view of a Flat List Query](media/using-queries-new-vsts-exp.png) 

2. Save the query to your **My Queries** folder.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Save As query dialog, new experience](media/view-run-queries/save-as-new-exp.png)  

   To save a query to the **Shared Queries** folder, you need to be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md), or have your **Contribute** permissions on the folder set to **Allow**. To learn more, see [Set query permissions](set-query-permissions.md).

1. Open a shared query. For example, from the web portal, open the *Active Bugs* or similar flat list query.   

   ![Web portal, Boards>Queries, Open Shared queries, Active Bugs](media/using-queries-active-bugs-ts.png)  

   > [!TIP]  
   > If you're working in Visual Studio Team Explorer, open the **Work** page to access your queries and shared queries. If Team Explorer isn't visible, choose **View>Team Explorer** from the top level menu.   

1. Edit the query to find closed bugs and then run the query. 
   Use ![Insert new filter line](media/3.png) to insert a clause above the current clause. Use ![Remove this filter line](media/4.png) to delete a clause.

   To save a query to the **Shared Queries** folder, you need to be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md), or have your **Contribute** permissions on the folder set to **Allow**. To learn more, see [Set query permissions](set-query-permissions.md).

## Rename or delete a query

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

From either the **Favorites** or **All** page, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon of a query to run, edit, rename, or delete the query. 

![New query experience, Favorites page, query context menu](media/view-run-queries/query-context-menu-favorites-page.png)  

For shared queries, you can also choose to perform one of these tasks: 
- **Add to team queries**: Select the team to add the query as a team favorite
- **Security...**: to set permissions for the query. To learn more, see [Set query permissions](set-query-permissions.md).   
- **Add to dashboard**: Adds a Query tile widget to the team dashboard you select. To learn more, see [Add widgets to a dashboard](../../report/dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md). 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"  

Choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/context_menu.png" border="false"::: context menu icon of a query to edit, rename, or delete the query.

## Add a query folder, move items into a folder 

> [!TIP]   
> You need **Delete** permissions to rename or move a shared query or folder, and **Contribute** permissions for the folder where you move the query to. To view or set permissions, see [Set permissions on queries and query folders](set-query-permissions.md).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You add query folders from the **Boards>Queries>All** page.
 
1. Choose **All**. Expand **My Queries** or Shared Queries depending on where you want to add a query folder. 
 
1. To add a folder, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon for an existing folder or the top container folder, and choose **New folder**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open Actions menu, choose New folder](media/organize-queries/select-new-folder.png)

2. Enter the name for the folder in the New folder dialog. If you want to change the location of the folder, select it from the Folder drop down menu.  

	<img src="media/organize-queries/new-folder-dialog.png" alt="Enter the name and location of the folder." style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. To move items into a folder, drag-and-drop a query onto the folder. 

	Optionally, you can choose **More commands** :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false":::   for an existing query, choose **Edit**, and then choose **Save As**. In the Save query as dialog, choose the folder you want to save the query in. 

	<img src="media/organize-queries/save-query-as-dialog.png" alt="Save query as dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
  
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

You add query folders from the **Boards>Queries** page.

1. To add a folder, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/context_menu.png" border="false"::: context menu for an existing folder or the top container folder and select **New query folder**. 

	Enter the name for the folder in the New query folder dialog.

1. To move items into a folder, drag-and-drop a query onto the folder. 

	Optionally, you can choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/context_menu.png" border="false"::: context icon for an existing query and choose **Rename**. In the Rename query dialog, select the folder you want to save the query in.

## Add a query to the dashboard or share it with your team 

To add a query to the home page or a dashboard, open the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon (or :::image type="icon" source="media/22.png" border="false"::: context icon) menu for the query and [add it to a specific dashboard](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md) or as a team favorite. 

Share queries with your team by adding them to a folder under the **Shared Queries** container.  To save a query to a Shared Queries folder, get added to the [project administrators group](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or have your [permissions set for a folder under Shared Queries](set-query-permissions.md). 

You can only add shared queries to dashboards or as team favorites, and only if you have [team administrator or project administrator permissions](../../organizations/settings/manage-teams.md).
