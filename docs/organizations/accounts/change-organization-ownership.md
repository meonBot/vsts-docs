# Change the organization owner

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

As roles and responsibilities change, you can change the owner for your organization.

> [!NOTE]  
> Changing the organization owner doesn't remove the old owner from the Project Collection Administrators group.

## Prerequisites

You must be a [**Project Collection Administrator** or an **organization Owner**](../security/lookup-organization-owner-admin.md). If no one in the organization has these permissions, contact [Azure DevOps Support](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/index.html). Make sure the owner has completed the following tasks:

- Sign in to your organization, create a profile, and agree to the Terms of Service
- Access the organization at least once after creating your initial profile

> [!TIP]
> For organizations connected to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD),  if your organization Owner and any other Project Collection Administrators are no longer active, you can [transfer ownership to another user](resolve-orphaned-organization.md).  

## Change organization Owner

1. Sign in to your organization (`https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

   ![Select "Organization settings"](../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)

3. Select **Overview**, and then **Change owner**.

4. Select a user from the dropdown menu, or search for a user by entering the user's name, and then select **Change**.

   ![Enter and save a new organization Owner](media/change-organization-ownership/save-new-organization-owner.png)

Your organization has a new owner.
