## Post-upgrade customizations to make manually 

The upgrade makes a best-effort attempt to reconcile the system process and the customizations made to the Hosted XML process. After you upgrade, we recommend you review the inherited process and reapply customizations manually. 

- [Create a test project](../work/upgrade-hosted-to-inherited.md#verify): Use to verify the customizations preserved or reapplied to a process
- [Update the default value for any field](../work/customize-process-field.md): define any default values you had previously defined
- [Workflow states](../work/customize-process-workflow.md): verify the mapping of states to workflow state categories 
- [Custom rules](../work/custom-rules.md): You can recreate select rules as needed. Rules for the Hosted XML process model don't map one-to-one to rules defined for an Inherited process. Specifically:   
	- Several rules are already defined in the system process or autogenerated. For example, certain system fields such as Changed By, Change Date, Closed By, Closed Date are governed by system rules. 
	- Some rules are now specified as field attributes, such as making a field a default or required.  
- [Disable work item types](../work/customize-process-work-item-type.md#enable-disable).
- [Hide inherited fields or controls](../work/customize-process-field.md#show-hide-or-remove-a-field).
- [Custom controls](../work/custom-controls-process.md): verify that custom controls are applied as expected; disable or hide unwanted [groups or page extensions](../work/custom-controls-process.md#group-level-and-page-level-contributions).
